### I can't decide what data structure to use
You need to do lookups, and we just learned that a `HashMap` gives you
constant time lookups. Go back to the reading to understand how to map a
single key to multiple values.

Then you can decide what key and value types to use for your `HashMap`,
and whether you should create multiple `HashMaps` for different lookups!
